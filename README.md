# COVID-19-CASES-PREDICTION
## Background
A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold [1]. 

California is reporting the fourth-highest rate of new COVID-19 cases per capita in the country, and the state's hospitals are overwhelmed and considering rationing care. Several regions have gone under new stay-at-home orders in recent weeks [2].

At this time, learning about California statistics and their relations with COVID-19 cases numbers is very meaningful. It gives us understanding about why some regions have more cases and others don't. It will also give us ideas about how to prevent COVID-19 spread more efficiently.
